# Website Traffic Generator

Dynamically optimised use of threads and included a list of residential proxies, stored as a secret URL.

Output can reach 100k in a matter of minutes, depending on your configuration.

## Additional improvements:

* Minimum and maximum time spent on each page - This simulates a more realistic browsing behavior by adding a delay between requests.
* Number of requests - Allows the user to set a specific number of requests to be made.
* Avoid repetition - An option for the user to decide whether each page view should be unique, preventing the same page from being loaded repeatedly within the session.
